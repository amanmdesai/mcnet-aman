# Process Cross Section

## Exercise 1

Energy  : 6.5 + 6.5 TeV
p p collision 
cross section in pb

-  p p > t t~ 

xsec: 505.5 ± 4.2 

-  p p > t t~ QCD=0

xsec: 0.3579 ± 0.0024 
no qcd vertex

-  p p > t t~ QED=0

xsec: 505.5 ± 4.2 (same as p p > t  t~)
no qed vertex

-  p p > t t~ QED<=2

xsec: 506.1 ± 3.9  (a little higher)
 QED vertex 2 or less than two

-  p p > t t~ QED=2

xsec: 506.1 ± 3.9 
same as previous case 

-  p p > t t~ QCD^2==2

xsec:  	-3.068e-16 ± 4.6e-18
Returns interference between QCD and QED

## Exercise 2

- p p > e+ e-
xsec : 839.1 ± 2.6 

peak of z  is visible along with the falling background

- p p > z, z > e+ e-
xsec :  1420 ± 0.91 

mass distribution surrounded around z mass

- p p > e+ e- $ z
xsec :  213.2 ± 0.55 
z peak not so enhanced as previously 
prevents s-channel z to be on-shell (one sees (almost) no z is in the mass)

- p p > e+ e- / z
xsec :  207.5 ± 0.53 
no z peak
prevent using this 
as it leads to gauge violation



set WT auto when the mass of the particle is changed
